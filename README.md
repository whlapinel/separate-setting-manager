The aim of this project is twofold:

a. To learn how to use the React library and NextJS front-end framework.

b. To replace a system currently in use at my school for registering EC students for separate testing rooms. Some students have testing accommodations requiring them to test in rooms with no more than 12 children present. Currently we use forms and spreadsheets for this purpose but this could be further automated and streamlined to reduce mistakes and time lost to submitting (teachers) and reading (principals) forms. Please not that all data in this repository is completely fictional, "dummy" data.

Users will be able to: 
- log in using their CMS google account.
- list all of their students (by class) requiring separate setting as well as any additional accommodations.
- enter test dates (by class) which will automatically register those students to the school's designated testing room(s).
- view the school's list of registered students (by day).

The system administrator will be able to:
- Designate testing room(s)


It is an opportunity for creating a very simple application that will help out my workplace, and learning new skills at the same time.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
